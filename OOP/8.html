            NOTES : bind() Method

                Definition:

                    bind() is a JavaScript method that creates a new function.
                    The new function has its this keyword set to a specific value.
                    
                Purpose:

                    Ensures the function maintains the correct this context.
                    Especially useful when passing functions as arguments or using them in callbacks.
                    Key Concepts:

                this Context:

                    Refers to the object currently executing the code.
                    The value of this can change depending on how a function is called.
                    
                Binding Functions:

                    A functionâ€™s this context can vary based on invocation.
                    bind() fixes the value of this, ensuring it always refers to a specific object.
